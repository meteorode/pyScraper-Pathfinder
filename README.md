====================

A python based tool to download the tables of equipment, spells, etc. for Pathfinder Pen &amp; Paper RPG and prepare them for use with PAR5E to create modules for Fantasy Grounds 2.

I plan to add in some CLI switches to allow finer grained control of exactly which set of data to extract from http://www.d20pfsrd.org.
